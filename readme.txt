I, Netanel Yehuda (203247978), assert that the work I submitted is entirely my own.
I have not received any part from any other student in the class, nor did I give parts of it for use to others.
I realize that if my work is found to contain code that is not originally my own, a
formal case will be opened against me with the BGU disciplinary committee.
